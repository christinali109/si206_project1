I love cats, I love every kind of cat,
I just wanna hug all of them, but I can't,
Can't hug every cat,
Can't hug every cat.
I'm thinking about cats again, and again, and again, and again, and again,
I think about how many don't have a home,
and how, I should have them...
I think about how cute they are,
and how their ears
and their whiskers and their nose.
I just love them, and I want them,
and I want them in a basket, and I want little bow-ties
I just love them, and I want them, to be on a rainbow,
and in my bed, and I just want us to roll all around,
to roll all around, round, round, meow!
Sorry, I'm getting emotional.
I love cats, I love every kind of cat,
I just wanna hug all of them, but I can't,
Can't hug every cat,
Can't hug every cat.
So anyway, I am a cat lover,
and I love to run,
I'm sorry, I'm thinking about cats again,
I really love all cats,
but I can't hug every cat,
Can't hug every cat.
Can't hug every cat.
